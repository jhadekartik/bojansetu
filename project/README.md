## About
## About
BhojanSetu is a social impact-driven web platform designed to address one of the most pressing issues in urban and rural areas: food wastage and hunger. Every day, restaurants, households, and event organizers end up with surplus food that often goes to waste, while millions of people still struggle to get a single proper meal. BhojanSetu creates a bridge between those who have surplus food and those who need it.  

The platform provides a simple, responsive, and accessible interface where:  
- Donors (restaurants, individuals, or organizations) can quickly list surplus food items along with details like quantity, type of food, pickup location, and availability window.  
- Receivers (NGOs, individuals, or communities in need) can browse available donations, request food items, and track the status of their requests in real-time.  

The solution is designed with **ease of use, transparency, and scalability** in mind. With its mobile-first responsive design, BhojanSetu ensures accessibility for all kinds of users, even with limited digital literacy. The platform also aims to integrate notification systems, request tracking, and future scalability features like **AI-driven demand prediction** and **location-based donorâ€“receiver matching**.  

BhojanSetu is not just a project; it is an initiative to encourage community collaboration and responsible resource sharing. By connecting surplus food providers with people in need, it contributes toward **zero hunger

4. Optionally, notifications or mail alerts are triggered when new donations or requests appear.
